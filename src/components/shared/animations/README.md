# Accessibility

Animations will not be accessible to screen readers. So add the following:

- role
- aria label

Example:
AnimationPageLoading.tsx

- role="img"
- aria-label="Loading animation which says Good to see you again! Just one moment - we're getting everything ready"

# Styles

Keep all styles inside the same file as the animation JSX
